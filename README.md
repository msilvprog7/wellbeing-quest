# Wellbeing Quest

An app to encourage introspection and reflection

## About

The project is just getting started. I'm creating
this side-project to explore new technologies with
4 hours a week for 12 weeks to deliver the first
feature. The first feature will be an app to log
weekly activities that make you feel relexed or
accomplished. During the week, you can check-in
on your progress. At the end of the week, you
get a weekly report to see how you prioritized
your wellbeing.
